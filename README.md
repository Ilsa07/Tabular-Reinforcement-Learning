# Tabulated Reinforcement Learning
This project illustrates Reinforcement Learning methods in a simple Grid World environment. Within the environment, there are obstacles, absorbing states that terminate the agent with a negative reward, and a goal state, which gives a positive reward to the agent. The goal of the agent is to reach the goal state in as few steps as possible, since the reward is discounted at each step. In the project two reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented, Monte Carlo Learning and SARSA, and compared to optimisation algorithms, namely value and policy iteration. This project was developped as an assignment at Imperial College London, and the environment was provided.

### Optimisation - Value and Policy Iteration

### Monte Carlo Learning

### SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
